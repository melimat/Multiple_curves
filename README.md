<h1>Multiple curves</h1>
<p>
Tool for plotting multiple curves (lines) into one graph. Input data should be in ".txt" format and output is a graph with legend.
It was originally created for visualyzing data from Vernier DAQ system, but it could be adapted for other input data format.

I developed this tool on virtual machine running linux (Ubuntu 16.4), but it can run on every operating system. Only required are installed Python (developed on 2.7 version) and Matplotlib library
